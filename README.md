ðŸš€ Key Features:
âœ… Student Request Submission:
Students can submit OD requests by providing details like the event name and date of absence.

âœ… Event Leader Verification:
Requests are first sent to an Event Leader, who verifies whether the student was part of the event.

âœ… Faculty Approval:
Once verified by the event leader, the request is forwarded to the respective faculty/teacher for approval or rejection.

âœ… Real-time Request Status:
Students can check the status of their OD requests (Pending / Approved / Rejected) anytime.

âœ… Role-Based Access:
The system has three roles:

Student: Can submit OD requests and track their status.

Event Leader: Can verify OD requests.

Faculty: Can approve or reject verified OD requests.
